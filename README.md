# fracergu-site

This is a React version of my personal website.
The reason for it is to have a place to manage the different tools I have deployed in my home lab, and to have a simple portfolio to show my skills.
I hope it will grow with time and I will be implementing my new knowledge in it, to also have it as a reference point.

### Tools I used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)
